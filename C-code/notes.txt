Visualize Resolution change
GST_DEBUG=2,xvimagesink:5 ./video-gen


    The idea is we want to make an appsrc based source of data for video instead of audio
    We can pick some format for which generating video is easy (GRAY8 or RGB)
    Once we are able to get some frames going (it's okay if it's the same frame in a loop), we'll add another wrinkle
    We want to emulate changing the video resolution on the fly
    First, let's just have a simple appsrc ! videoconvert ! autovideosink pipeline to see these changes occur
    Next, we want to store the changing video in a file, let's say with vp8enc for the codec, and webmmux for the container
    Why are we doing this? We want to see if we can construct a test case for this: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-good/-/merge_requests/1008


1. Reproducing issue: instead of videosink -> pass it through (vp8enc/vp9enc) encoder & matroska multiplexer -> write to file (filesink)
2. Testing the fix: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-build

what is colorimetry?
does it work fine with the patch ?

videoconvert : GBR to I420


1280 x 720

play with freq of res changes and length of the file
check matroska file
mkvtoolnix

changing framerate multiple times
changing the output number of frames

varying length of output - send an EOS event from appsrc
2 sec video @ 30 fps -> send 60 frames then send EOS
